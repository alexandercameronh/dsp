### Q1.  Cheat Sheet of Commands  

Here's a list of items with which you should be familiar:  
* show current working directory path
* creating a directory
* deleting a directory
* creating a file using `touch` command
* deleting a file
* renaming a file
* listing hidden files
* copying a file from one directory to another

Make a cheat sheet for yourself: a list of at least **ten** commands and what they do.  (Use the 8 items above and add a couple of your own.)  

> > 'pwd' - show current working directory path
'mkdir' - create a directory
'rm -r' - delete a directory
'touch filename.txt' - creating a file using touch command
'rm' - delete a file
'mv' - rename a file. for example, 'mv spiderman.txt batman.txt' - spiderman renamed as batman
'ls -a' - list hidden files
'cp' - copy a file from one directory to another
'whoami' - displays your username
'tail' - displays the last ten lines of a file
'cat' - reads one or more files and displays standard output
'>' - redirection - takes the standard output of the command on the left and redirects it to the file on the right
'>>' - similar to that above but simply appends

### Q2.  List Files in Unix   

What do the following commands do:  
`ls`  
`ls -a`  
`ls -l`  
`ls -lh`  
`ls -lah`  
`ls -t`  
`ls -Glp`  

> > 'ls' -- lists all files and directories within your current working directory \n
'ls -a' -- lists all files and directories within working directory INCLUDING files with names beginning with a '.'
'ls -l' -- lists all files and directories in 'long format' as a table 
'ls -lh' -- 'h' option does not exist, lists files in long format
'ls -lah' -- 'h' option does not exist - lits files in long format (including hidden files)
'ls -t' -- sorts the list of all files and directories by the time in which they were last modified
'ls -Glp' -- capital G option does not exist. If this is a typo and supposed to be 'ls -glp' then this will list in long format, excluding username, and including directories with /
