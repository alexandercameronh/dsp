[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

>> After creating a list of 1000 random numbers (between 0 and 1), both the PMF and CDF were plotted.

>> The PDF plot is extremely dense, and the CDF has a perfect diagonal slope - this indicates that there

>> is a uniform distribution among the randomly generated numbers


>> (code for this problem is available in the uploaded ipython notebook: Stats+Exercise+Solutions.ipynb)
