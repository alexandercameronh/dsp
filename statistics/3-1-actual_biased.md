[Think Stats Chapter 3 Exercise 1](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2004.html#toc31) (actual vs. biased)

>> After plotting both pmfs, we can see that the mean for the Bias PMF is slightly higher than that of the Initial PMF
>> That is, the mean number of children per household for the Bias PMF is roughly 2.4;
>> the mean number of children for the initial pmf is 1.02


>> (code for this problem is available in the uploaded ipython notebook: Stats+Exercise+Solutions.ipynb)
